      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the trade-off between the ability of a model to fit the training data well (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data (low variance). In other words, the bias-variance trade-off is the balance between the complexity and flexibility of a model, and its ability to make accurate predictions on both the training and testing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
