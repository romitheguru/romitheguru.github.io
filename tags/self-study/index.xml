      <description>&lt;p&gt;This world is full of ambitious people who are lifelong learners. They pursue knowledge even while managing careers or businesses, whether to satisfy their curiosity or to enhance their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a lifelong learner, though perhaps not among the highly ambitious. Learning is my passion - I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to newer technologies and understanding more about the world. I am a full-time machine learning engineer. If you follow AI news, you know a lot is happening in this field. Even keeping up with a single sub-field is challenging. Yet, I consistently try to learn about new methods and technologies that could create value in my work. To do so I need to find a dedicated time to self-study. In this post, I will share my experience with self-learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
