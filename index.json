[{"content":"In recent years, machine learning (ML) has rapidly advanced and become a key component of modern technology. Whether applied to recommendation systems, autonomous driving, healthcare, or finance, machine learning’s influence is undeniable. Many practitioners in the field come from diverse backgrounds, sometimes with limited formal mathematical training but strong programming and data manipulation skills. While this might be sufficient to implement machine learning models using popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn, there is a compelling case for deepening one’s understanding of mathematics even when you already have hands-on experience in building models. Mathematics provides the theoretical foundation for machine learning and enables practitioners to elevate their work, enhance model performance, and solve complex problems with greater insight and creativity.\nThis essay will explore several key reasons why learning mathematics is essential for machine learning professionals. It will cover the role of math in understanding model behaviour, optimizing performance, creating new models, avoiding common pitfalls, and effectively communicating ideas.\nUnderstanding Model Behaviour and Inner Workings Machine learning models, particularly complex ones like deep neural networks, are often treated as black boxes by those who lack mathematical training. With strong libraries available to abstract much of the underlying complexity, it’s possible to build and deploy models without fully understanding how they work. However, this is a risky approach. Without a solid grasp of the mathematical principles that govern these algorithms, you might miss important insights into their behaviour, limitations, and potential failure modes.\nFor example, linear regression is a simple algorithm used frequently in ML. On the surface, it seems straightforward: find the best fit line for a given set of data points. But what does “best fit” mean? How does the algorithm determine this? The answer lies in concepts from calculus (gradient descent) and linear algebra (matrix operations). Understanding these mathematical concepts allows you to grasp how the model makes predictions, why it behaves the way it does, and how to interpret the coefficients and performance metrics meaningfully.\nBy studying the underlying mathematics, you can understand not just how models like neural networks or support vector machines (SVMs) work, but why they behave the way they do under different conditions. This depth of understanding empowers you to make better decisions when tuning models, selecting algorithms, or designing architectures.\nOptimising Model Performance When building machine learning models, practitioners often focus on improving metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Achieving high performance typically involves hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and experimenting with different algorithms. While practical experience helps with these tasks, a firm mathematical foundation can give you a more sophisticated toolkit for optimisation.\nFor instance, consider the concept of regularisation, a critical technique used to prevent overfitting. Regularisation adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages complex models from fitting the noise in the data. Understanding L1 and L2 regularisation in terms of norms and vector spaces can help you determine when to use them, how to adjust the penalty terms, and why they are effective in certain situations. Without this mathematical insight, regularisation might just seem like an arbitrary trick.\nSimilarly, optimisation algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop are at the heart of most modern ML models, but they operate on mathematical principles from calculus and statistics. Knowing how gradients work, why learning rates matter, and how loss surfaces behave gives you greater control over the training process, helping you avoid issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, slow convergence, or getting stuck in local minima.\nCreating and Innovating New Models While existing machine learning models and algorithms can handle many real-world problems, innovation in the field requires a deep understanding of mathematics. Practitioners who want to go beyond using pre-built models and instead contribute to advancing the state of the art will inevitably need to master the mathematical theories that underlie machine learning.\nFor example, generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rely on advanced topics from probability theory, linear algebra, and information theory. To truly innovate with these models, you need to understand concepts like Kullback-Leibler divergence, latent space, and Jensen-Shannon divergence. Armed with this knowledge, you can push the boundaries of current models or even create new ones better suited to specific tasks.\nMoreover, learning mathematics equips you with the tools to break down complex problems and formulate new algorithms from scratch. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, professionals with strong mathematical expertise are more likely to lead these innovations by designing algorithms that address limitations in existing methods or tackle new challenges altogether.\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls Machine learning models are often sensitive to the quality of the input data, and incorrect assumptions or overlooked details can lead to flawed results. A solid understanding of statistics, probability, and linear algebra helps practitioners recognize these pitfalls before they become major issues.\nOne common pitfall is overfitting, where a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Knowing the mathematical foundations behind model complexity and regularization allows you to effectively combat overfitting. Similarly, understanding the bias-variance tradeoff, another core statistical concept, can help you balance model flexibility with generalization.\nAnother example is in handling data. Matrix operations are central to many machine learning algorithms, and errors in understanding matrix dimensions, properties, or decompositions can lead to incorrect implementations. Additionally, probability theory is essential for tasks like estimating uncertainty in predictions, interpreting results, and designing models for tasks involving randomness, like reinforcement learning or Bayesian inference.\nWithout this mathematical foundation, you might miss subtle issues in data processing, model evaluation, or even in the assumptions of the algorithms themselves, leading to inaccurate or misleading results.\nEffective Communication and Collaboration Finally, mathematics is the universal language of machine learning and data science. Whether you are working in a team of engineers, collaborating with researchers, or presenting your work to stakeholders, the ability to communicate the principles behind your models is invaluable. Even though many people can understand the output of a model (such as a prediction or classification), fewer can appreciate the nuances of how that output was achieved.\nBy developing a solid understanding of the mathematical principles that govern machine learning models, you can effectively explain your choices, justify trade-offs, and collaborate with others who are more mathematically inclined. This skill is particularly important in interdisciplinary teams where data scientists, engineers, statisticians, and domain experts work together. Clear communication based on a shared understanding of mathematical principles ensures that the entire team can align on model goals, limitations, and capabilities.\nConclusion While it is possible to build machine learning models with a basic understanding of mathematics, a deeper knowledge of mathematical principles offers numerous advantages. It allows you to understand how models work, optimise their performance, create new algorithms, avoid common pitfalls, and communicate effectively with others in the field. As machine learning continues to evolve, those with strong mathematical foundations will be better positioned to innovate, solve complex problems, and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of the field. Therefore, investing in learning mathematics is a crucial step for anyone serious about mastering machine learning.\n","permalink":"https://romitheguru.github.io/posts/general/why_learn_maths/","summary":"How Mathematical Mastery Enhances Your Machine Learning Success","title":"Why Should You Learn Mathematics for ML"},{"content":"Today, the internet is flooded with information. It isn\u0026rsquo;t easy to keep up with everything happening in the field. However, to be successful you have to keep yourself informed. The problem is you can only read some things due to time constraints. So, it becomes crucial that whatever little time you spend in consuming information you make the best out of it. But how can you do that? How can you understand and retain most of the information that you read? There’s a simple yet powerful technique that can help you gauge and improve your understanding: summarising content in your own words.\nSummarising is the process of distilling information down to its core ideas and concepts. By writing a summary of what you’ve read without looking back at the original material, you force yourself to engage with the content actively. This process not only reveals how much you’ve understood but also reinforces learning and retention.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the benefits of summarising, break down the process, and provide tips for effectively using this technique to enhance your comprehension and mastery of any subject.\nWhy Summarise the Content We consume educational content through various mediums. Some prefer watching videos. Others prefer to read. Irrespective of the medium, learning aims to deeply understand the concept.\nBut how do you know if you have thoroughly understood the concept? When you go through the content, you feel fairly confident. However, as time passes you start to forget a lot of details without even realising this fact even if you remember all the details. What if someone asks you a question related to the topic? You will not be able to answer the question unless you have a deep understanding of the topic. At times like this, you realise that there might be a gap in your understanding.\nYou can avoid this pain if you assess your understanding of the topic right after finishing it. There are several techniques to do this. My favourite is summarisation. It is a quick and effective way to assess your understanding of the topic. After going through a topic, take some time and write a summary of it. Writing a summary is not an easy process unless you understand the topic. It requires you to identify the core ideas and concepts. If you struggle to write a summary this would indicate that there is a knowledge gap. The summarisation process will reveal exactly where are you struggling and what you need to work on.\nSummarisation is not only helpful in revealing a knowledge gap. It also improves memory and critical thinking. When you summarise something, it forces your brain to recall the right pieces of information and connect those pieces into a much shorter summary than the original text. It improves your overall comprehension and helps you save a ton of time later.\nHaving understood the importance of summarisation, let’s dive into the practical aspects of how to effectively summarise content.\nThe Summarisation Process The summarisation process is very straightforward. Here’s how I do it:\nI first identify the core idea of the topic. Then, I identify the supporting ideas and key characteristics of the core idea. Once I’ve identified these details, I write a summary in simple terms, omitting specific details. If I encounter multiple smaller core ideas, I try to connect them and explain how they fit together to form the bigger picture. This reveals a lot about my understanding of the text.\nWhile writing the summary I keep the following things in my mind.\nDid I understand the concept well? Am I able to recognise the characteristics of the idea? Can I make the connection to the other related ideas? Can I write an even shorter summary of this? There are many different techniques to summarise content.\nMind Mapping: Create a visual diagram with the main topic in the centre and related ideas branching out. Start with the central concept, then add major themes as primary branches. Add details and sub-ideas as secondary branches. A mind map helps visualise connections between ideas and organise information hierarchically. The Feynman Technique: No summarisation method is complete without mentioning the famous Feynman technique. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, it involves explaining a concept in simple terms. After reading a topic, try to explain it to a child or someone unfamiliar with the topic. Identify gaps in your explanation and revisit the material. Simplify and use analogies to make the concept clearer. It helps identify gaps in understanding and reinforces learning through teaching. Concept Mapping: Similar to mind mapping, but focuses more on showing relationships between concepts. Write key concepts in boxes or circles, then connect them with labelled lines showing their relationships. Helps understand complex systems and how different ideas relate to each other. Cornell Method: Divide your page into three sections: notes, cues, and summary. Take notes in the largest section during reading or lecture. Write cues/questions in the left column to test your understanding later. Summarise the main ideas in the bottom section. Encourages active engagement with the material and provides a built-in review system. Outlining: Organise information in a hierarchical structure with main points and supporting details. Identify main topics as Roman numerals, subtopics as capital letters, and details as numbers or lowercase letters. It helps structure information logically and see relationships between ideas. How do I use summarisation? When I first learned linear algebra, I encountered the concepts of vectors and matrices. These are abstract concepts. I learned the formal definitions of vectors and their properties. Then, I learned how they relate to matrices. To solidify my understanding of these abstract concepts, I found it helpful to write summaries of what I learned.\nFor example, I wrote the following summary: Vectors are simply arrays of numbers. There are defined rules for operating on these arrays, such as adding two vectors or multiplying a vector by a number.\nHow do you add two vectors? The first thing to consider is that the vectors you want to add must have the same size. If the first array has 10 numbers, then the second array must also have 10 numbers. To add these arrays, suppose you have two rows. Write one array in the first row and the second array in the second row. Then, look at the corresponding numbers within those arrays and add them together like regular numbers. The result is another array with the same number of elements as the original two arrays.\nSimilarly, to interpret the equation Ax = b, where A is a matrix, x is a vector of unknowns, and b is a resultant vector, I thought of A as a map. Upon multiplication, a matrix transforms vector x to vector b.\nThese kinds of summaries helped me develop the intuition needed to understand the subject. While summarisation is a powerful tool, it’s not without its difficulties. Let’s examine some common challenges and how to overcome them.\nChallenges in Summarisation While summarisation is a powerful tool for enhancing understanding. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. Recognising these difficulties and learning how to overcome them is crucial for effective summarisation. Let’s explore some common challenges and strategies to address them.\nIt is important to distinguish the main idea from the supporting ideas. Many readers struggle to identify the core concept in a sea of information. Practice the “so what?” test. For each point, ask yourself, “So what? Why is this important?” If it’s crucial to the overall message, it’s likely a main idea. For example, if you are reading about the vectors in linear algebra. You can find the text talks about a bunch of stuff. Ask yourself, so what? The answer should you the importance of vectors.\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is the personal biases. Personal biases can influence how you interpret and summarise information. Try to go through the material with an open mind. Ask as many questions as possible to understand the underlying concept. This will help you overcome your own biases and understand the content better. Then write a summary based on your understanding. Focus on summarising what the text says, not your opinion of it.\nSummaries can become too long or too brief, missing the balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness. Follow the 80/20 rule. Aim to capture 80% of the main content in 20% of the original length.\nConclusion Throughout this essay, we’ve explored the powerful impact of summarisation on learning and understanding. The key benefits we’ve discussed include:\nEnhanced comprehension of complex topics Improved retention of information Development of critical thinking skills Identification of knowledge gaps More efficient learning and studying Summarisation serves as a versatile tool, applicable across various fields and learning contexts. It not only helps in academic settings but also in professional development and personal growth.\nNow, it’s time to put this knowledge into action. Challenge yourself to incorporate summarisation into your daily learning routine. Start small — perhaps summarise this article you are reading. As you practice, you’ll find your ability to distil and retain information improving significantly.\nIt’s a skill that, once mastered, will serve you well in all areas of life where learning and information processing are key. So, pick up that pen, open that notebook, and start summarising.\n","permalink":"https://romitheguru.github.io/posts/general/learning_through_summarisation/","summary":"Today, the internet is flooded with information.

Problem-Solving Skills - Ability to solve complex problems with minimal guidance. Communication Skills - Ability to communicate your ideas effectively with other team members and stakeholders. Let\u0026rsquo;s look into each of these areas:\nTechnical Skills For technical skills, there are two main aspects: 1) the tech stack and 2) conceptual understanding.\nHiring managers are interested in knowing your comfort level with the tech stack they work with. They may judge you based on your proficiency with particular software packages. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re applying for an AI engineer role, you need to know deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. For machine learning, you need to know Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, etc. You may be asked questions related to the usage of these technologies. So, check the tech stack used for the role you\u0026rsquo;re applying for and prepare accordingly.\nThe second aspect you may be judged on is conceptual understanding. Interviewers may ask questions to gauge your comfort level with particular topics. For example, for a data science role, they might ask questions related to machine learning, probability, statistics, or mathematics.\nThe ability to code is also very important for data science and machine learning roles. Hence, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to know the fundamental topics of your programming language. For example, in Python, you need to know about lists, tuples, dictionaries, OOP concepts, iterators, and generators.\nProblem-Solving Skills Hiring managers want to recruit people who can solve complex problems. To check problem-solving skills, different companies interview candidates in various ways. Typically, they conduct one or more rounds of coding and algorithmic problem-solving interviews. Based on the seniority levels, they may also conduct case study and/or system design interviews.\nPrepare for coding problem-solving at least a month before. You can practice on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.\nSimilarly, prepare for case studies or design interviews. You usually learn these skills while working. There\u0026rsquo;s no shortcut to improving these skills. However, you can read examples of case studies and system designs for many different problems.\nCommunication Skills Finally, communication skills are equally important. Even if a candidate has all the technical knowledge required for a role, they might be rejected if they fail to communicate clearly with the interviewers. Within companies, projects are team efforts. You need to communicate regularly within your team as well as with other teams. In a data science role, you often need to present your model\u0026rsquo;s output to stakeholders. Hence, communication skills are crucial.\nInterviewers don\u0026rsquo;t typically have a round focused solely on communication skills. Instead, they evaluate your communication skills throughout the entire interview process.\nFor experienced candidates, hiring managers like to know about your past projects. They want to know what you did in your previous company, what situations you faced, and how you tackled them. They also like to know the value or impact you created. So, practice how you will present your previous projects.\nAdditional Tips Mock interviews: Practice with peers or mentors Time management: Solve problems under timed conditions Whiteboard practice: Explain solutions visually Verbalise thought process: Practice thinking aloud Prepare questions: Show genuine interest in the role Review your own projects: Be ready to discuss in depth Develop a problem-solving framework: Approach questions systematically Practice explaining complex concepts simply Negotiating Job Offers You\u0026rsquo;ve successfully navigated the application process and received a job offer. However, your journey isn\u0026rsquo;t quite over. Negotiating your job offer is a crucial step that can significantly impact your career trajectory and job satisfaction.\nBefore entering negotiations, arm yourself with knowledge. Research industry standards for data science salaries in your area using resources like Glassdoor, PayScale, or the annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey. This information will provide a solid foundation for your negotiation strategy.\nRemember, negotiation isn\u0026rsquo;t just about salary. Consider the entire compensation package, including benefits, bonuses, stock options, remote work flexibility, and professional development opportunities. A lower base salary might be offset by excellent benefits or growth potential.\nWhen you begin negotiations, approach the conversation as a collaborative discussion rather than an adversarial process. Articulate your value proposition clearly, highlighting your unique skills, experience, and potential contributions to the company. Be confident, but maintain a positive and professional tone throughout.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s generally advisable to start your negotiation with a figure slightly higher than your target, giving you room to compromise. However, ensure your request is realistic and based on your research. If the company can\u0026rsquo;t meet your salary requirements, be open to discussing other forms of compensation or benefits.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t feel pressured to accept an offer immediately. It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to ask for a few days to review the details. Use this time to carefully consider all aspects of the offer and prepare for further negotiation if necessary.\nFrom personal experience, I can tell you that negotiation is a normal and expected part of the hiring process. In my transition from software engineering to data science, I initially received an offer that was below my expectations. By discussing my skills and the value I could bring to the role, we were able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that included not just a higher salary, but also additional training opportunities.\nRemember, if you don\u0026rsquo;t ask, you don\u0026rsquo;t get it. Most employers expect candidates to negotiate, and it\u0026rsquo;s often viewed as a positive trait. By approaching the negotiation thoughtfully and professionally, you can ensure that you\u0026rsquo;re fairly compensated for your skills and experience in your new data science role.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve reached an agreement, make sure all the details are documented in your offer letter or contract. This protects both you and the employer and ensures there are no misunderstandings down the line.\nBy following these steps and approaching negotiations with confidence and preparation, you\u0026rsquo;ll be well-positioned to secure a compensation package that reflects your true value as a data scientist.\nConclusion Starting a career in data science is an exciting journey filled with opportunities for growth, innovation, and impact.
