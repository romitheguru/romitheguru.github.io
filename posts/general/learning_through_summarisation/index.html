It isn’t easy to keep up with everything happening in the field. However, to be successful you have to keep yourself informed. The problem is you can only read some things due to time constraints. So, it becomes crucial that whatever little time you spend in consuming information you make the best out of it. But how can you do that? How can you understand and retain most of the information that you read? There’s a simple yet powerful technique that can help you gauge and improve your understanding: summarising content in your own words.\nSummarising is the process of distilling information down to its core ideas and concepts. By writing a summary of what you’ve read without looking back at the original material, you force yourself to engage with the content actively. This process not only reveals how much you’ve understood but also reinforces learning and retention.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the benefits of summarising, break down the process, and provide tips for effectively using this technique to enhance your comprehension and mastery of any subject.\nWhy Summarise the Content We consume educational content through various mediums. Some prefer watching videos. Others prefer to read. Irrespective of the medium, learning aims to deeply understand the concept.\nBut how do you know if you have thoroughly understood the concept? When you go through the content, you feel fairly confident. However, as time passes you start to forget a lot of details without even realising this fact even if you remember all the details. What if someone asks you a question related to the topic? You will not be able to answer the question unless you have a deep understanding of the topic. At times like this, you realise that there might be a gap in your understanding.\nYou can avoid this pain if you assess your understanding of the topic right after finishing it. There are several techniques to do this. My favourite is summarisation. It is a quick and effective way to assess your understanding of the topic. After going through a topic, take some time and write a summary of it. Writing a summary is not an easy process unless you understand the topic. It requires you to identify the core ideas and concepts. If you struggle to write a summary this would indicate that there is a knowledge gap. The summarisation process will reveal exactly where are you struggling and what you need to work on.\nSummarisation is not only helpful in revealing a knowledge gap. It also improves memory and critical thinking. When you summarise something, it forces your brain to recall the right pieces of information and connect those pieces into a much shorter summary than the original text. It improves your overall comprehension and helps you save a ton of time later.\nHaving understood the importance of summarisation, let’s dive into the practical aspects of how to effectively summarise content.\nThe Summarisation Process The summarisation process is very straightforward. Here’s how I do it:\nI first identify the core idea of the topic. Then, I identify the supporting ideas and key characteristics of the core idea. Once I’ve identified these details, I write a summary in simple terms, omitting specific details. If I encounter multiple smaller core ideas, I try to connect them and explain how they fit together to form the bigger picture. This reveals a lot about my understanding of the text.\nWhile writing the summary I keep the following things in my mind.\nDid I understand the concept well? Am I able to recognise the characteristics of the idea? Can I make the connection to the other related ideas? Can I write an even shorter summary of this? There are many different techniques to summarise content.\nMind Mapping: Create a visual diagram with the main topic in the centre and related ideas branching out. Start with the central concept, then add major themes as primary branches. Add details and sub-ideas as secondary branches. A mind map helps visualise connections between ideas and organise information hierarchically. The Feynman Technique: No summarisation method is complete without mentioning the famous Feynman technique. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, it involves explaining a concept in simple terms. After reading a topic, try to explain it to a child or someone unfamiliar with the topic. Identify gaps in your explanation and revisit the material. Simplify and use analogies to make the concept clearer. It helps identify gaps in understanding and reinforces learning through teaching. Concept Mapping: Similar to mind mapping, but focuses more on showing relationships between concepts. Write key concepts in boxes or circles, then connect them with labelled lines showing their relationships. Helps understand complex systems and how different ideas relate to each other. Cornell Method: Divide your page into three sections: notes, cues, and summary. Take notes in the largest section during reading or lecture. Write cues/questions in the left column to test your understanding later. Summarise the main ideas in the bottom section. Encourages active engagement with the material and provides a built-in review system. Outlining: Organise information in a hierarchical structure with main points and supporting details. Identify main topics as Roman numerals, subtopics as capital letters, and details as numbers or lowercase letters. It helps structure information logically and see relationships between ideas. How do I use summarisation? When I first learned linear algebra, I encountered the concepts of vectors and matrices. These are abstract concepts. I learned the formal definitions of vectors and their properties. Then, I learned how they relate to matrices. To solidify my understanding of these abstract concepts, I found it helpful to write summaries of what I learned.\nFor example, I wrote the following summary: Vectors are simply arrays of numbers. There are defined rules for operating on these arrays, such as adding two vectors or multiplying a vector by a number.\nHow do you add two vectors? The first thing to consider is that the vectors you want to add must have the same size. If the first array has 10 numbers, then the second array must also have 10 numbers. To add these arrays, suppose you have two rows. Write one array in the first row and the second array in the second row. Then, look at the corresponding numbers within those arrays and add them together like regular numbers. The result is another array with the same number of elements as the original two arrays.\nSimilarly, to interpret the equation Ax = b, where A is a matrix, x is a vector of unknowns, and b is a resultant vector, I thought of A as a map. Upon multiplication, a matrix transforms vector x to vector b.\nThese kinds of summaries helped me develop the intuition needed to understand the subject. While summarisation is a powerful tool, it’s not without its difficulties. Let’s examine some common challenges and how to overcome them.\nChallenges in Summarisation While summarisation is a powerful tool for enhancing understanding. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. Recognising these difficulties and learning how to overcome them is crucial for effective summarisation. Let’s explore some common challenges and strategies to address them.\nIt is important to distinguish the main idea from the supporting ideas. Many readers struggle to identify the core concept in a sea of information. Practice the “so what?” test. For each point, ask yourself, “So what? Why is this important?” If it’s crucial to the overall message, it’s likely a main idea. For example, if you are reading about the vectors in linear algebra. You can find the text talks about a bunch of stuff. Ask yourself, so what? The answer should you the importance of vectors.\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is the personal biases. Personal biases can influence how you interpret and summarise information. Try to go through the material with an open mind. Ask as many questions as possible to understand the underlying concept. This will help you overcome your own biases and understand the content better. Then write a summary based on your understanding. Focus on summarising what the text says, not your opinion of it.\nSummaries can become too long or too brief, missing the balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness. Follow the 80/20 rule. Aim to capture 80% of the main content in 20% of the original length.\nConclusion Throughout this essay, we’ve explored the powerful impact of summarisation on learning and understanding. The key benefits we’ve discussed include:\nEnhanced comprehension of complex topics Improved retention of information Development of critical thinking skills Identification of knowledge gaps More efficient learning and studying Summarisation serves as a versatile tool, applicable across various fields and learning contexts. It not only helps in academic settings but also in professional development and personal growth.\nNow, it’s time to put this knowledge into action. Challenge yourself to incorporate summarisation into your daily learning routine. Start small — perhaps summarise this article you are reading. As you practice, you’ll find your ability to distil and retain information improving significantly.\nIt’s a skill that, once mastered, will serve you well in all areas of life where learning and information processing are key. So, pick up that pen, open that notebook, and start summarising.\n","wordCount":"1546","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://romitheguru.github.io/summarisation.webp","datePublished":"2024-07-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-07-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Romee
